# Bala Sai Teja Talachiru
I am an aspiring software developer, currently advancing my skills in Information Technology Project Management with a Masters at Arizona State University, set to graduate in May 2025. With a strong foundation in Computer Science from IIIT Rajiv Gandhi University, I had excelled academically, delving into diverse areas such as Advanced Database Management, Big Data, and Cloud Computing. My technical prowess extends across a spectrum of languages and tools, including Scala, Python, Java, Angular, React, and NodeJS, complemented by my experience with databases and cloud platforms like MySQL, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, and Azure.
Professionally, I made significant strides as a Software Developer at Turito Inc, Hyderabad, where I honed the skills in front-end development using Angular 8, TypeScript, and CSS, and engaged in complex projects involving SQL, MongoDB, and Scala. My role involved not just coding, but also contributing to code reviews, project architecture discussions, and employing tools like Jira and Jenkins for efficient project management. In academia, My projects, such as the Mood-Based Music Player with Facial Recognition and Leaves Management System for University Students, demonstrate my ability to integrate machine learning, data management, and user-friendly design into functional applications. I am with a blend of academic knowledge and practical experience, through which I am poised to make a significant impact in the field of software development.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
